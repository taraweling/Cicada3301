3301

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

In 2012, a mysterious message appeared on
4chan that referred to an entity called
"3301." The message contained another 
secret messege within it, a clue, a cypher. 
Those who found this clue were then led to
another, and another, until the trail went cold...

Modeled after this international 
informatics events of the 10's, our game
immerses you in a world of cyphers, 
monsters, and mysteries as well.
